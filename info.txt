[STEAM_CHANGELOG: Live version will no longer push into your installed mods to update your already generated world, sorry little documentation on some of these things, it's very much guess and check for a few of these systems, if you still have your original worldgen version, stay with that until you want to make a new world and then the new animals and amalgamation attributes will join you from that point on, sorry about the misunderstanding.]
